Bounty
================================

A funding platform for PPAU

Something to keep in mind;
- "If a card token is not used within 1 month it is automatically expired."
- Considering the merchant fee charged, increase the goal to absorb it?
- PIN requires that pages be HTTPS?
- Implement a donation ID?
