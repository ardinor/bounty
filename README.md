Bounty
================================

Not much here yet.

Something to keep in mind;
- "If a card token is not used within 1 month it is automatically expired."
- Considering the merchant fee charged, increase the goal to absorb it?
- PIN requires that pages be HTTPS?
- Make new models for Petition and Group Purchase (or a new one for fundraiser)..
